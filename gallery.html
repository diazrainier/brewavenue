						       	<p>What if your job wasn’t tethered to a desk or a time clock? For an increasing number of workers, the rise of telecommuting — working for an employer, but typically working offsite instead of at a desk or cubicle in an office — presents an attractive option. It’s not just for freelancers any more. Increasingly, businesses are offering either partial or full-time telecommuting to their employees, whether they’re writers, designers, accountants, or salespeople. As Forbes bluntly stated it, Telecommuting Is the Future of Work.</p>

						       	<p>At a glance, telecommuting offers plenty of positives. There’s a degree of flexibility that makes telecommuting attractive to employers (it’s cost effective, and leads to less hours lost to things like illness and bad weather). Workers also see potential, especially if they’re parents with young children, people with long commutes, the easily-distracted, and those of us who don’t keep conventional hours. But one interesting finding from a 2012 study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (The Hard Truth about Telecommuting) was that telecommuting, despite its hype, hasn’t delivered on the promise of better work-life balance. Indeed, demands on workers typically increase, with some employers expecting — or even demanding — ’round the clock availability.</p>

						       	<p>Against that backdrop, how can a telecommuter carve out a sense of balance and sanity? One answer could be as close as the nearest coffee shop. Benefits include:</p>

						       	<p>Fewer Distractions: At first, this would seem to make no sense at all. Coffee shops are often bustling and noisy. Believe it or not, all that activity helps rather than hinders. The low-level hum of all that chatter helps to shut out other background noise, and unlike a radio, television, or your MP3 player, there’s not as much temptation to drop what you’re doing to pay attention to something else, whether it’s a news report, a plot twist, or a song you haven’t heard in ages.</p>

						       	<p>A Change in Scenery: Let’s face it, the walls of your home office (or living room, breakfast nook, or wherever else you typically set up at home) get a bit dull after a while. Getting out of your usual space — and the usual routine that goes with it — keeps you energized, and can be a big help in getting those creative juices flowing.</p>

						       	<p>Socialization: There’s often no way around the fact that working at home can sometimes be a bit like solitary confinement. There’s no chat around the water cooler or over lunch (we doubt if your cat’s going to have much to say about the latest plot twist on Game of Thrones), and no winding down at happy hour after work (dogs and martinis don’t mix). A bit of idle chatter with strangers, or the other regulars, goes a long way toward staving off isolation.</p>

						       	<p>Collaboration: Those chance meetings have another benefit. After all, you’re often meeting people in the same circumstances as you, so it’s an ideal environment for swapping leads, advice, and strategies. And if you’re stuck on an especially challenging work issue, it never hurts to get a second opinion or another set of eyeballs on it. That’s much harder to do when you’re working from home.</p>

						       	<p>Caffeine: The free flow of coffee can help to keep you alert and keep your energy levels up, which can be especially helpful when you’re coming down the home stretch of a long or difficult project.</p>

						       	<p>We’d be remiss if we didn’t mention a bit of etiquette. For one thing, be sure to order regularly (at least once an hour). That might seem expensive, but you’re in someone’s place of business. And that cost is much lower than the cost of renting office space. For another, pay attention to the footprint of your workspace. How much space are you, your laptop, your notes, your phone, briefcase, charger, and other odds and ends taking up? Also be aware of the time; working during a cafe’s busiest times can be an annoyance for everyone involved, and working during off-peak hours can help keep you from wearing out your welcome. Above all, be mindful and respectful.</p>

						       	<p>Telecommuting is currently in a phase of slow but steady growth. Its increasing popularity is reflected not only in the growing number of telecommuting jobs available on sites like Indeed and Monster, but also on sites where telecommuting jobs make up a significant portion of the job listings (Flexjobs) or their entirety (We Work Remotely, a spinoff of the original 37 Signals job board). As the opportunities expand, employers and job seekers alike are left to navigate a maze of challenges. For the latter, at least, the local coffee shop is a good place to address the promise, and the challenges, head on.</p>

						       	<p>Coffee is one of the most ubiquitous and unifying products in the world. It is, in one form or another, consumed in great volume in every corner of the earth. Needless to say, it is an enormous industry that employs untold millions of people from bean pickers to marketing executives. Coffee is also a cornerstone upon which countless other industries are founded. Without coffee, how many of us would witness a decline in our productivity at the office? Heck, how many of us would witness a noticeable decline in our overall happiness? Coffee holds a great power over modern society and, especially, over the modern worker. Here are eight compelling reasons to embrace our java overlord:</p>

						       	<p>1. It keeps you alert
								As we all know, caffeine is one of the most common stimulants readily found in many domestic products. Caffeinated coffee keeps people awake and provides their central nervous systems with a boost that helps keep them productive throughout the day.</p>

						       	<p>2. Coffee breaks improve productivity
								The coffee break is a 20th century invention, becoming more prevalent following the Second World War. A 2010 study at MIT showed that employees who take coffee breaks together demonstrate an overall improvement in their productivity. These breaks create a forum within which employees can share both personal and work-related experiences. Allowing employees to take these breaks together showed a lift in overall performance.</p>

						       	<p>3. It may help you live longer
								The US National Institute for Health released a study that found a correlation between the amount of coffee consumed and risk of death. From the study: "The researchers found that the association between coffee and reduction in risk of death increased with the amount of coffee consumed. Relative to men and women who did not drink coffee, those who consumed three or more cups of coffee per day had approximately a 10 percent lower risk of death."</p>

						       	<p>4. It can reduce pain for desk workers
								Another study conducted by the National Institute for Health concluded that consuming caffeine before performing pain-inducing computer work resulted in attenuated pain development versus subjects who did not consume caffeine. Admittedly, the sample size of the study is small, but the results show the possibility of prescribing caffeine as an everyday pain moderator.</p>
						       	

						       	<p>5. Coffee is social
								Over the last 30 years, the proverbial coffee pot has assumed the role of the office water cooler. Being a coffee drinker in an office setting lends itself to greater social interaction that can be directly tied to increased productivity. More importantly, coffee drinkers at work tend to be happier in their jobs.</p>
						       	
						       	<p>6. Your colleagues drink a lot of it
								In 2011, a survey released a list of the professions that consumed the most amount of coffee. Rounding out the top 5 in the list: scientists/lab technicians, marketing/PR professionals, education administrators, writers/editors and healthcare administrators.</p>

						       	<p>7. It can reduce sleep-deprived stress
								If you are sleep-deprived, the mere aroma of coffee has been showed to reduce stress levels. A study at the Seoul National University compared the expression of certain genes and proteins in rats' brains when exposed to the aroma of coffee. According to the study, those exposed to the coffee odour presented proteins that have healthful antioxidant properties known to protect nerve cells from stress-related damage whereas those not exposed to the coffee smell did not show these gene expressions.</p>
						       	
						       	<p>8. It keeps you trim
								Numerous studies have linked the consumption of caffeine to increased metabolic activity. As such, it should come as no surprise that most commercial fat burning supplements contain caffeine. While the metabolic impact of caffeine may not be enough to eat away at that beer gut single-handedly, it doesn't hurt to know that your body is burning fat at a higher rate as you sit at your desk and sip your cup of Joe.</p>
